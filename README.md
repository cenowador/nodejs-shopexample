# nodejs-shopexample-mysql
This is a simple shop application example based around Node.js. It has all the basic features that one would expect from an online store: an admin area, a cart, a product showcase and payment integration.

The purpose of this software is to study and develop my skills in Node.js.

It uses:
 
- Express as web framework,
- MongoDB as database (using mongoose),
- Pug as templating engine,
- Mocha/Chai/Sinon as test builders
- Nodemailer as e-mail sending engine and
- Stripe as payment processing (sandbox)
